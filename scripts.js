// Color:
// A color should have a random hex code
// hint: hex codes are 6 characters long, and each character is some value of 0-9 or A-F (ABCDEF0123456789)
// Though there are many examples of this logic coded out, this type of crunchy problem solving is well within your skill set!
// Donâ€™t look up how to accomplish this; challenge yourselves to use pseudocode to problem-solve through it!
// It should have a property of locked, whose value is a boolean. Colors begin unlocked.

// Stores all characters that might appear in a hex code

//pseudocode
//goal: be able to generate a random hex code
//data: onclick invoke function that will need to generate a string with 6 characters containing values between 0-9 and A-F
  //will need to update to h3 box
//questions: are there existing methods that generate random? Should we create an array with 0-9 and A-F? What should hex codes look like -- what's the format?
